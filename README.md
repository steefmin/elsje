# Elsje
A node.js bot for slack, that maintains a tasklist for all channels. Built with https://github.com/howdyai/botkit. Only in Dutch. 

# History
A lot of work has been done on the fork of botkit on: https://github.com/steefmin/botkit. Restarted using this repo after using botkit as submodule in stead of hardcoding it in the repo. 

Elsje has been named after the comic figure of Scouting Nederland https://www.facebook.com/ScoutingNieuwEinde/posts/414645681952084.
